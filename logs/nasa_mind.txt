TITLE: PROPOSAL

Celestial navigation has historically served as the foundational methodology for the collection of samples and data pertaining to celestial objects beyond our home — Earth. In our modern times, technological advancements have facilitated the automation of certain parts of celestial exploration, proven by missions such as Preservance’s exploration of Mars and OSIRIS-REx’s collection of an asteroid sample. Nonetheless, a common characteristic is shared by these engineering marvels is their significant financial cost, single model deployments, and the fact the collected data is static, meaning it is not updated routinely—like lunar soil. 

We propose an idea in which the financial cost would be minimized to that of a rovers. Our innovation would allow for multi-deployment instances of it—like an ant colony, and it’s collection of data would be routinely, allowing for real time data. We aim to maintain a continuous process of data analysis concerning the lunar surface’s topography, radiation levels, and atmospheric conditions, and potentially extend this approach to other celestial surfaces. It is even conceivable that a similar model could be applied within our own planet’s unique environments.
Our primary objective is to understand the dynamic alterations in lunar terrain, tracking and studying how they evolve over time. We aim to investigate whether the lunar surface undergoes variation due to atmospheric and environmental factors. Such data analysis holds the potential to assist us in identifying optimal settlement locations and conditions.

With the assistance of our school’s talented computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, biologists, and the collective effort of experts from various related disciplines, we are confident that anything can be achieved. Our conception can be envisioned as a compact device, similar in size to a conventional smartphone, possibly even smaller. 

The lower surface of our vehicle is designed for anchoring purpose, implying that it will need to be manually implanted into the lunar surface. We are considering whether astronauts should deploy these devices themselves or user a rover-like vehicle to automate the process for a more efficient deployment. The idea of astronauts deploying them while exploring lunar terrain in their vehicles seems particularly efficient. 

As we move up towards the rectangular sides of our device, the central compartment will be utilized for integration of our sensors, which constitute the core feature of our device. Our primary components encompass GPS sensors, temperature sensors, atmospheric sensors, and radiation sensors. The GPS sensors are positioned within the device to facilitate retrieval, tracking, and the potential mapping of the device’s location on the celestial surface. It is imperative that data from a specific device is correlated with precise coordinate points on the celestial body. The temperature sensors serve the purpose implied by their name: monitoring temperature variations across different regions of the lunar surface. This data aids in informed decision-making regarding the suitability of specific areas for infrastructure development and potential colonization. Furthermore, this dataset can be subjected to time-series analysis for further understanding. The atmospheric sensors enable the collection of data on the lunar atmosphere, contributing to our understanding of how atmospheric conditions vary across different locations. This knowledge can impact the design and development of equipment tailored for lunar conditions, both present and future. The radiation sensors play a critical role due to the absence of atmospheric and magnetic shielding on the lunar surface. Collecting substantial and real-time data is crucial for the safety of astronauts and for determining suitable base location. 

In conclusion, the uppermost component of our device is exclusively allocated for solar sensors, which are vital for autonomous power generation, ensuring an extended operational lifespan. Despite the apparent simplicity of our device, when deploying in large numbers, they function collectively as a data farm—a lunar data farm. 

Through consistency, dedicated hard work, and effective teamwork, we are confident that we can transform this concept into a reality. Our ultimate aim is to contribute to the advancement of the colonization of celestial terrains. As students of Dominican University, we are fully prepared to take on this role, and we hope that NASA is open to welcoming us into the NASA MINDS initiative.
